herb hunt
---------

    something like triforce hunt where you need to hunt down a certain amount of medical herbs

progressive swords/armor/magic
------------------------------

    would increase the places to search a lot. It feels like a hundro (100% randomizer) a lot of times now, I think it will when this gets added

hints
-----

    crystal ferries could give hints, instead/in addition of items

make souls randomized (and progressive)
---------------------------------------

    yes, even the first one, given by the magician.
